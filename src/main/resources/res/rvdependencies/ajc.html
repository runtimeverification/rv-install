AspectJ is an aspect-oriented programming based compiler required by 
RV-Monitor to provide automatic instrumentation for several of the Java 
examples we provide.

It is also possible to use manual instrumentation or other instrumentation
mechanisms with RV-Monitor. Please skip this step and see the documentation
provided after install for instructions.
