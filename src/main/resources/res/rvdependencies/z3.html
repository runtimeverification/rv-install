<h2>We have detected that Z3 is not installed.</h2><hr><br><br><p>
Z3 is a constraint solver required by RV-Predict to detect races in 
programs.  To use RV-Predict, you must install Z3 from the link below 
and add it to your system's PATH.  Once Z3 is installed, check the
checkbox below.
<br><br>
Alternatively, it is possible to use Yices, a different constraint 
solver, with RV-Predict.  Please skip this step and see the README 
after install for instructions on using Yices with RV-Predict.
